E2 Table is taken for fetching Managers. Hence E2 denotes Managers.
E1 Tables denotes employees which are not managers.

SELECT E1.ID, E1.ENAME, E2.ID MGRID, E2.ENAME MGRNAME, C1.MODEL E_MODEL, C2.MODEL M_MODEL
FROM EMPLOYEE E1 INNER JOIN EMPLOYEE E2
ON E1.MANAGER=E2.ID AND E2.COMPID IS NOT NULL
INNER JOIN COMPUTER C1 ON 
C1.COMPID = E1.COMPID
INNER JOIN COMPUTER C2 ON
C2.COMPID = E2.COMPID



Another Query for this question:

SELECT E.ID, E.ENAME, M.ID MGRID, M.ENAME MGRNAME, C.MODEL E_MODEL,
(SELECT MODEL FROM COMPUTER WHERE COMPID = M.COMPID) M_MODEL 
FROM EMPLOYEE E INNER JOIN COMPUTER C ON E.COMPID = C.COMPID
INNER JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MANAGER = M.ID AND M.COMPID IS NOT NULL;
